Hereâ€™s a short reflection you can use or adapt for your website project:

 ðŸ”¹ Reflection

Creating my personal resume website was a valuable learning experience. I chose a clean and simple layout to ensure my content was clear and easy to navigate. The use of sections like About Me, Education, Experience, and Contact helped organize my information effectively.

One challenge I faced was managing image and file paths, especially when using local files that wouldnâ€™t display properly in the browser. I also struggled a bit with formatting, like aligning elements and making sure everything looked consistent across the page. Solving these issues helped me understand the importance of correct folder structure and clean coding.

Through this project, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS more deeply and gained confidence in building structured web pages. It taught me the importance of attention to detail, testing, and improving based on feedback. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that encouraged me to continue learning web design.
